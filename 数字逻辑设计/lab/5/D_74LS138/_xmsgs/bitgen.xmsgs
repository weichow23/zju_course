<msg type="error" file="Bitgen" num="342" delta="new" >This design contains pins which have locations (LOC) that are not user-assigned or I/O Standards (IOSTANDARD) that are not user-assigned.  This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected.  To prevent this error, it is highly suggested to specify all pin locations and I/O standards to avoid potential contention or conflicts and allow proper bitstream creation.  To demote this error to a warning and allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O location or standards, you may apply the following bitgen switch: -g UnconstrainedPins:Allow

Most commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the generic command-line value of &quot;Auto&quot;.  Alternately, this message appears if the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this case, the option listed last will be used.
