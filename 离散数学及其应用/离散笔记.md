## Chapter 1 The Foundations: Logic and Proofs

### Propositions Logic

#### Propositions and Logical Operators

`Definition` <u>Propositions</u> is a statement that is either true(1) or false(0), but not both.

`Remark`: Propositions must be statements.

#### Logic Operators (Connective)

1. **Negation**(not $p$): $\neg p$

2. **Conjunction**($p$ and $q$): $p \and q$

3. **Disjunction**($p$ or $q$):$p \or q$

4. **Implication**(If $p$ Then $q$): $p \to q$. False only if $p$ is true and $q$ is false. 
    $p$ is called the *hypothesis ( or premise)* and $q$ is called the *conclusion (or consequence)*.

	`Remark` Everything implies truth; False implies anything. 

5. **Biconditional**($p$ If and only if $q$): $p \leftrightarrow q$

translate English sentences into logical expression.

#### Propositional Formula

`Definition` **Formula**(sometimes called a <u>well-formed formula</u>, or **wwf**): 

1. Each propositional variable is a formula, and the truth values $T$ and $F$ are formulas.
2. If $A$ and $B$ are formulas, so are $\neg A, (A\and B), (A\or B),(A \to B),(A \leftrightarrow B)$.
3. A string of symbols is a formula only as determined by (finitely many applications of) the above three rules.

#### Classification of Propositional Formula

- A proposition is a **tautology**(重言式) if its truth table contains only true values for every case.
- A proposition is a **contradiction**(矛盾式) if its truth table contains only false values.
- A proposition is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called **contingence**(可满足式).

### Propositional Equivalences

`Definition`: Formula $A$ and $B$ are called <u>logically equivalent</u> if $A \leftrightarrow B$ is tautology, denoted by $A \Leftrightarrow B$.

`Example`:

1. $p \to q \Leftrightarrow \neg p \or q ,\quad p\leftrightarrow q \Leftrightarrow(\neg p \or q)\and(p \or \neg q)$
2. $p \to q \Leftrightarrow \neg q \to \neg p$
3. De Morgan's laws: $\neg(p \and q) \Leftrightarrow \neg p \or \neg q$; $\quad \neg(p \or q) \Leftrightarrow \neg p \and \neg q$.

#### Propositional Normal Forms

Formulas can be transformed into standard forms, there are 2 types of normal forms in propositional calculus: DNF and CNF.

`Definition`**Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**:

1. A **literal** is a variable or its negation.
2. Conjunctions with literals as conjuncts are called **conjunctive clauses**. Conjunctive clauses are simply called clauses.
3. A formula is said to be in **disjunctive normal form** if it is written as a disjunction, in which all the terms are conjunctions of literals.

`Example`: $(p\and q)\or (p \and \neg q)$ is in disjunctive normal forms.

`Therom`: Any formula $A$ is tautologically equivalent to some formula in disjunctive normal form.

#### Full Disjunctive Form

`Definition`: A <u>minterm</u> is a conjunction of literals in which each variable is represented exactly once.

![image-20230115000826202](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301150008231.png)

`Definition`: If a Boolean function is expressed as a disjunction of minterms, it is said to be in <u>full disjunctive form</u>(主析取范式).

`Definition`: **Conjunctive Normal Form** expresses a compound proposition as the conjunction of clauses where each clause is the disjunction of two or more variables or its negation.

#### Methods of Proof

### Predicates and Quantifiers

#### Predicates

`Definition`: A statement of the form $P(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n)$ is the value of the <u>propositional function</u> $P$ at the n-tuple $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$, and $P$ is also called a <u>predicate</u>. $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is an element of a set $D$.

#### Quantifiers

Universal quantifier: 	For all $x,p(x)$$:$$\quad\forall x p(x)$

Existential quantifier: 	For some $x,p(x)$:$\quad \exist x p(x)$

#### Banding Variables

`Definition`: When a quantifier is used on the variable $x$ or when we assign a variable to this variable, this occurrence of the variable is <u>bound</u>, other occurrence of the variable is <u>free</u>.

#### Logical Equivalences Involving Quantifiers

De Morgan's laws for predicts:

- $\neg \forall x p(x) \Leftrightarrow \exist x \neg p(x)$

- $\neg \exist x p(x)\Leftrightarrow \forall x \neg p(x)$

Quantifiers with Conjunction and Disjunction:

-  $\forall x(p(x)\and q(x))\Leftrightarrow (\forall x p(x))\and(\forall x q(x))$

- $\exist x(p(x)\or q(x))\Leftrightarrow(\exist x p(x))\or(\exist x q(x))$

#### Prenex Normal Forms

`Definition`: A formula is in <u>prenex normal form</u>(前束范式) if it is of the form $Q_1x_1Q_2x_2\dots Q_n x_n B$, where$Q_i(i=1,2,\dots,n)$ is $\forall $ or $\exist$ and $B$ is quantifier free. Any expression can be converted into prenex normal form. 

#### Methods of Proof

## Chapter 2 Basic Structures: Sets, and Functions

### Sets

#### Sets and Subsets

`Definition`: The object in a <u>set</u> are called <u>elements</u>, or members, of the set. A set is said to contain its elements.

- The ways of describing sets:

	- List

	- Predicate(Stating the properties)

	- Venn Diagram

- Properties of sets:

	- Order of elements doesn't matter.
	- Repetition of elements doesn't matter.
	- Certainty

- Infinite and Finite Set

	- Cardinality of set $S(|S|)$ is the number of elements in $S$.

`Definition`: If and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, we use the notation $A \subseteq B$ to indicate that A is a <u>subset</u> of the set $B$, which means $\forall x(x\in A \to x \in B)$ is true.

**proper subset**: $\forall x(x \in A \to x \in B)\and \exist x(x\in B \and x \notin A)$.

For any set $A,\quad \subseteq A,\quad \empty \subseteq A \subseteq U$.

### Set Operations

#### Set Operations

- Union: $\quad A \cup B = \{ x | x \in A \or x \in B\}$
- Intersection: $\quad A \cap B = \{x| x\in A \and x \in B\}$
- Difference: $\quad A-B = \{x| x \in A \and x \notin B\}$
- Complement: Let $U$ be the universal set, $\bar{A} = U -A$
- Symmetric Difference: $\quad A \oplus B = (A-B)\cup (B-A)$

#### Set Identities

#### The Power Set and Cartesian Products

`Definition`: Given a set $S$, the power set of $S$ is the set of all subsets of it. <u>The power set</u>(幂集) of is denoted by $P(S)$ or $2^S = \{T | T \subseteq S\}$.

`Definition`: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The <u>Cartesian product</u> of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \in A,b\in B$. Hence, $A \times B = \{(a,b)|a \in A \and b \in B\}$.

- $A^2 = A \times A$ (the Cartesian square of A)
- If $A$ has $m$ elements, $B$ has $n$ elements, then $A\times B$ has $m\cdot n$ elements, also finite.
- If $A$ infinite and B non-empty, $A\times B,B\times A$ is infinite.
- $A \times \empty = \empty \times B = \empty$
- In general, $A \times B \ne  B \times A$
- $\times$ disturbs over $\cap$ and $\cup$.

`Definition`: The Cartesian product of $A_1,A_2,\cdots ,A_n$, denoted by $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n$, is the set of all ordered n-tuples $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$ where $a_i \in A_i$ for $i=1,2,\cdots n$. In other words, for $i \in \mathbb{N} $,  $A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n = \{(a_1,\cdots,a_n)|a_i \in A_i \}$.

### Cardinality of Finite and Infinite Sets

#### Counting finite sets

- Cardinality: The size of a set $S$, denoted by $|S|$.
- Principle of Inclusion-exclusion: $|A \cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301192135226.png" alt="image-20230119213524167" style="zoom: 40%;" />

#### Cardinality of infinite sets

`Definition`: Two sets **have the same cardinality** (equinumerous) if there is an one-to-one correspondence from $A $ to $B$, i.e. $|A|=|B|$.

Infinite sets are divided into two types:

- countable (denumerable) set: A set is either finite or has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$

- uncountable set

`Therom`: The cardinality of the power set of an <u>arbitrary set</u>(任意集) has a greater cardinality than the original arbitrary set, or $|2^A|>|A|$.

`Therom`: The set of real numbers is uncountable.

`Proof`: (1) $|(0,1)| = |\mathbb{R}|\quad$(2) $(0,1)$ is uncountable.

### Functions

#### Introduction

`Definition`: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A <u>function</u> $f$ from $A$ to $B$ : $\forall a \in A ,\exist !b\in B :f(a)=b$

- $A$ is the <u>domain</u> of $f$, Dom $f = A$
- $B$ is the <u>codomain</u> $f$, Codom $f=B$
- $b$ is the <u>image</u> of $a$, $a$ is a <u>pre-image</u> of $b$
- The <u>range</u> of $f$ is the set $\{b\in B | \exist a\in A,f(a)=b\}$

#### One-to-one and Onto Functions

`Definition`: Let $f$ be a function from $A$ to $B$:

- <u>one-to-one function</u>(injection)(单射): $\forall a,b \in A \and a \ne b \Rightarrow f(a) \ne f(b)$
- <u>onto funtion</u>(surjection)(满射):$\forall b\in B,\exist a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$
- <u>bijection function</u>(one-to-one correspondence)(双射/一一映射): one-to-one + onto

####  Inverse and Composition of Functions

`Definition`: Let $f$ be a one-to-one correspondence from $A$ to $B$. The <u>inverse function</u> of $f$, $f^{-1}:B \to A\qquad \forall a \in A,b \in B(f(a)=b)\Leftrightarrow(f^{-1}(b)=a)$, which is called <u>invertible</u>.

`Definition`: Let $g:A\to B,f:B\to C$ are two functions. The <u>composition</u> of the functions $f \circ g:A \to C \qquad \forall a \in A, (f \circ g)(a)=f(g(a))$

#### Some Important Functions

`Definition`: 

- The <u>floor function</u> $\lfloor x \rfloor$ assigns to the real number $x$ the largest integer that $\le x$.

- The <u>ceiling function</u> $\lceil x \rceil$ assigns to the real number $x$ the smallest integer that $\ge x$.

`Remark`: The floor function is also called the <u>greatest integer function</u>, denoted by $[x]$.

#### The growth of functions

`Definition`: <u>Big-O Notation</u>. Let $f$ and $g$ be functions from the set of integers or the set of real numbers. We say that $f(x)$ is $\mathcal{O}(g(x)) $ if there are constants $C$ and $k$ such that $|f(x)|\le C |g(x)|$ where $x > k$.

`Theorem`: Let $f(x)=a_n x^n+a_{n-1}  x^{n-1}+ \cdots +a_1 x+a_0$
, where $a_0, a_1, \cdots, a_n$ are real numbers. Then $f(x)$ is $\mathcal{O}\left(x^n\right)$.

`Definition`: Let $f$ and $g$ be functions from the set of integers or the set of real numbers. We say that $f(x)$ is $\Omega(g(x))$ if there are constants $C$ and $k$ such that
$|f(x)| \geq C|g(x)|$
wherever $x>k$. We say that $f(x)$ is $\Theta(g(x))$ if $f(x)=\mathcal{O}(g(x))$ and $f(x)=$ $\Omega(g(x))$. We also say that $f(x)$ is of <u>order</u> $g(x)$.

## Chapter 3 The Fundamentals: Algorithms

### Algorithms

#### Introduction

`Definition`: An <u>algorithm</u> is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or solving problem.

Properties of Algorithm:

- Input: the algorithm receives input from a special set.
- Output: the algorithm produces output.
- Definiteness: The step are precisely defined.
- Correctness: Produce the correct output for each set of input values.
- Finiteness: Stop after a finite number of steps for any input in the set.
- Effectiveness: Perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time.
- Generality: Applicable for all problem of desired form, not just for a particular set of input values.

#### Searching Algorithm

```pascal
procedure linear search (x: integers, a1,a2,...,an: distict integers)
i := 1
while(i < n and x != ai)
	i := i + 1
if i <= n then location := i
else location := 0
```

```pascal
procedure binary search (x: integers, a1,a2,...,an: distict integers)
i := 1
j := n
if i < j
begin
	m := (i+j)/2
	if x > am then i := m + 1
	else j := m
end
if x = ai then location := i
else location := 0
```

### Complexity of Algorithms

`Definition`: 

- Complexity: the amount of time and/or space needed to execute the algorithm.
- Space Complexity: be tied with particular data structures of used to implement the algorithm.
- Time Complexity: can be expressed in terms of number of operation used by the algorithm when the input has a particular size.

`Remark`: Types of Complexity:

- Best-case time = minimum time needed to execute the algorithm for inputs of size $n$
- Worst-case time = maximum time needed to execute the algorithm for inputs of size $n$

- Average-case time = average time needed

## Chapter 4 Induction and Recursion

### Mathematical Induction

**The Well-ordering Property**: Every nonnegative integers has a least element.

A proof by mathematical induction that $P(n)$ is true for every positive integer $n$ consists 2 steps:

1. Basic step. The proposition $P(1)$ is shown to be true.
2. Inductive step. The implication $P(n)\to P(n+1)$ is shown to be true for every positive integer $n$

### Recursive Definitions

#### Recursively Defined Functions

To define a function with the set of nonnegative integers as its domain,

1. Specify the value of the function at zero.
2. Give a rule for finding its value as an integer from its value at smaller integers.

	— is called **recursive** or **inductive definition**.

#### Recursively Defined Sets

Recursive definitions are often used in study of strings.

-  A **string** over an alphabet $\sum$ is a finite sequence of symbols from $\sum$.
- The set of strings over $\sum$ is denoted by $\sum^*$.
- Two strings can be combined via the operation of **concatenation**. The concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$, denoted by $xy$.
- The length of a string, which is the number of symbols in the string, can also be defined recursively.

#### Recursive Algorithms

`Definition`: An algorithm is called <u>recursive</u> if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smalled input.

```pascal
procedure power(a: nonzero real number, n: nonnegative integers)//compute a^n
if n = 0 then power(a, n) := 1
else power(a, n) := a * power(a, n - 1)
```

```pascal
procedure gcd(a, b: nonnegative integers with a < b)
if a = 0 then gcd(a, b) := b
else gcd(a, b) := gcd(b mod a, a)
```

```pascal
procedure search(i, j, x)
if ai = x then location := i
else if i = n then location := 0
else search(i+1, j, x)
```

## Chapter 5 Counting

### The Basics of Counting

#### Basic Counting Principle

`Definition`: <u>The Sum Rule</u>: If $A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_m$ are disjoint sets, then the number of elements in the union of these sets is the sum of the number of elements in them. $|A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots\cup A_m| = \sum^{n}_{i=1} |A_i|$

<u>The Product Rule</u>: If $A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_m$ are finite sets, then the number of elements in the cartesian product of these sets is the product of the number of elements in each set. $|A_1\times A_2\times \cdots \times A_m|=\prod^{n}_{i=1}|A_i|$

#### More Complex Counting Problems

### The Pigeonhole Principle

If $k+1$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects. — Dirichlet Drawer Principle

**The Generalized Pigeonhole Principle**: If $N$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least $\lceil N/k \rceil$ objects.

`Definition`: Suppose that $a_1,\cdots,a_N$ is a sequence of real number.

- A <u>subsequence</u> of this sequence is a sequence of the form $a_{i_1},\cdots,a_{i_m}$, where $1\le i_1<\cdots<i_m\le N$. Hence, a subsequence is a sequence obtained from the original sequence by including some terms of the original sequence in their original order.
- A sequence is called <u>strictly increasing</u> if each term is larger than the one that precedes it, and it's called <u>strictly decreasing</u> if each term is smaller than the one that precedes it.

### Permutations and Combinations

#### Permutations

`Definition`: Given a set of distinct objects $X=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$

- a **permutation**(排列) of $X$ is an ordered arrangement of $x_1,\cdots,x_n$
- a **r-permutation**, where $r\le n$ is an ordering of a subset of r-elements of $X$.
- The number of r-reputations of a set of distinct elements is denoted by $P(n,r)$

`Therom`: $P(n,r)=n(n-1)\cdots (n-r+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ In particular, note that $P(n,n)=n!$

#### Combinations

`Definition`: Let $X=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\}$ be a set containing $n$ distinct elements.

- An **r-combination**(组合) of $X$ is an unordered selection of $r$ elements of $X$.
- The number of r-combinations of a set of $n$ distinct elements is denoted by $C(n,r)$.

`Therom`: $C(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! r!}=\frac{P(n,r)}{r!}=\frac{P(n,r)}{P(r,r)}$

#### Binomial Coefficients

`Therom`: (Binomial Theorem) If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $n$ is a positive integer, then $(a+b)^n = C(n,0)a^n b^0 + C(n,1)a^{n-1}b^1 + \cdots + C(n,n-1)a^1b^{n-1} + C(n,n)a^0b^n=\sum_{i=0}^{n}C(n,i)a^{n-i}b^i$

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301271320658.png" alt="image-20230127132028550" style="zoom: 40%;" />

`Therom`: **Pascal's Identity**. Let $n,k\in \mathbb{Z^+}$ with $n\ge k$. Then $C(n+1,k)=C(n,k)+C(n,k-1)$

`Therom`: Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $\sum_{k=0}^{n}C(n,k)=2^n$

`Therom`: **Vandermonde's Identity**. Let $m,n,r\in \mathbb{N},r\le m,n. | C(m+n,r)=\sum_{k=0}^r C(m,r-k)+C(n,k)$

### Generalized Permutations & Combinations

#### Permutations with Reputation

`Therom`: The number of r-permutations of a set of $n$ objects with reputation allowed is $n^r$

#### Combinations with Reputation

`Therom`: There are $C(n+r-1,r)$ r-combinations from a set with $n$ elements when repetition of elements is allowed.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301271507633.png)

| select $r$ from $n$ | Permutations | Combinations |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| no reputation       | $P(n,r)$     | $C(n,r)$     |
| with reputation     | $n^r$        | C(n+r-1,n-1) |

#### Distributing Objects Into Boxes

`Therom`: The number of ways to distribute $n$ distinguishable objects into $k$ boxes so that $n_i$ objects are placed into box $i$, $i=1,2,\cdots,k$ equals $\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!}$.

### Generating Permutations and Combinations

#### Generating Permutations

We will describe one algorithm that is based on the **lexicographic ordering**(字典顺序) of the set of permutations of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$.

The permutation $a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$ **precedes** the permutation of $b_1b_2\cdots b_n$, if for some $k$, with $1\le k\le n,a_1=b_1,\cdots,a_{k-1}=b_{k-1}$, and $a_k < b_k$.

`Main idea`: A procedure that constructs the next permutation in lexicographic order following a given permutation $a_1a_2\cdots a_n$.

## Chapter 6 Advanced Counting Techniques

### Recurrence Relations

`Definition`:  A **recurrence relation** for a sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an equation that express $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence.

- A sequence is called a **solution** of recurrence relation if its term satisfy the recurrence relation.
- Initial condition

#### Modeling with Recurrence Relations

The Tower of Hanoi: $H_1 = 1,H_n=2H_{n-1}+1$. Hence, $H_n=2^n -1$

### Solving Recurrence Relations

`Definition`: A <u>linear homogeneous recurrence relation</u> of degree $k$ with <u>constant coefficients</u> is a recurrence relation of the form $a_n=c_1a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}+\cdots + c_k a_{n-k}$, where $c_i$ is real number and $\ne 0$.

#### Solving Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relations with Constant Coefficients

`Basic approach`: To look for solutions of the form $a_n= r^n$, where  $r$ is a constant.

- degree $k =2$

`Therom`: Let $c_1,c_2$ be real numbers. Suppose that $r^2-c_1 r -c_2 =0$ has two **distinct** roots $r_1,r_2$. Then the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is a solution of $a_n = c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}$ if and only if $a_n =\alpha_1 r_1^n+ \alpha_2 r_2^n$ for $n=0,1,2,\cdots$, where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ are constants.

`Therom`: Let $c_1,c_2$ be real numbers, $c_2\ne 0$. Suppose that $r^2-c_1r-c_2=0$ has only **one** root $r_0$. Then the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is a solution of $a_n = c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}$ if and only if $a_n = (\alpha_1+\alpha_2 n) r_0^n$ for $n=0,1,2,\cdots$, where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ are constants.

- degree $k\ge2$

`Therom`: Let $c_1, \cdots, c_k$ be real numbers. Suppose that the characteristic equation $r^k-c_1 r^{k-1}-\cdots-c_k=0$ has $k$ distinct roots $r_1, \cdots, r_k$. Then the sequence $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is a solution of the recurrence relation $a_n=c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}+$ $\cdots+c_k a_{n-k}$ if and only if
$a_n=\alpha_1 r_1^n+\alpha_2 r_2^n+\cdots+\alpha_k r_k^n$
for $n=0,1,2, \cdots$, where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_k$ are constants.

`Theorem`: Let $c_1, \cdots, c_k$ be real numbers. Suppose that the characteristic equation $r^k-c_1 r^{k-1}-\cdots-c_k=0$ has $t$ distinct roots $r_1, \cdots, r_t$ with multiplicities $m_1, \cdots, m_t$, respectively, so that $m_i \geq 1$ for $i=1,2, \cdots, t$ and $m_1+m_2+$ $\cdots+m_t=k$. Then the sequence $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is a solution of the recurrence relation $a_n=c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_k a_{n-k}$ if and only if
$a_n  =\left(\alpha_{1,0}+\alpha_{1,1} n+\cdots+\alpha_{1, m_1} n^{m_1-1}\right) r_1^n 
+\left(\alpha_{2,0}+\alpha_{2,1} n+\cdots+\alpha_{2, m_2} n^{m_2-1}\right) r_2^n  +\cdots+\left(\alpha_{t, 0}+\alpha_{t, 1} n+\cdots+\alpha_{t, m_t} n^{m_t-1}\right) r_t^n$
for $n=0,1,2, \cdots$, where $\alpha_{i, j}$ are constants.

#### Solving Linear Nonhomogeneous Recurrence Relations with Constant Coefficients

`Definition`: A <u>linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients</u> is a recurrence relation of the form $a_n=c_1a_{n-1}+c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots + c_k a_{n-k}+ F(n)$, where $c_i$ is real number and $F(n)$ is a function not identically zero depending only on $n$. The relation $a_n=c_1a_{n-1}+c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots + c_k a_{n-k}$ is called the **associated homogeneous recurrence relation**

`Theorem`: If $\left\{a_n^{(p)}\right\}$ is **particular solution**(特解) of the linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients$a_n=c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_k a_{n-k}+F(n)$,
then every solution is of the form $\left\{a_n^{(p)}+a_n^{(h)}\right\}$, where $\left\{a_n^{(h)}\right\}$ is a solution of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation$a_n=c_1 a_{n-1}+c_2 a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_k a_{n-k} .$

### Generating Functions

`Definition`: The <u>generating function</u> for the sequence $a_0,a_1,\cdots,a_k,\cdots$ of real numbers is the infinite series $G(x)=a_0+a_1x^1+\cdots+a_k x^k+\cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_k x^k$.

### Applications of Inclusion-Exclusion

#### Introduction

- **Principle of Inclusion-exclusion**: Let $A$ and $B$ are two finite sets, then$|A \cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A \cap B|$
- **The extended principle of inclusion-exclusion**$
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right|=\sum_{i=1}^n\left|A_i\right|-\sum_{1 \leq i \neq j \leq n}\left|A_i \cap A_j\right|+\cdots+(-1)^{n-1}\left|\cap_{i=1}^n A_i\right| \\$

#### Alternative Form of Inclusion-Exclusion





$A_i=\left\{x \mid x\right.$ has property $\left.P_i\right\}$; $N\left(P_{i_1} \cdots P_{i_k}\right)=\mid\left\{x \mid x\right.$ has all the properties $\left.P_{i_1}, \cdots, P_{i_k}\right\} \mid$
$N\left(P_{i_1} \cdots P_{i_k}\right)=\left|A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}\right|\\$

$N\left(P_1^{\prime} \cdots P_n^{\prime}\right)=\mid\left\{x \mid x\right.$ has none of the properties $\left.P_1, \cdots, P_n\right\} \mid$
$N=$ the number of the elements in the universal set
$N\left(P_1^{\prime} \cdots P_n^{\prime}\right)=N-\left|A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n\right|$

$N\left(P_1^{\prime} \cdots P_n^{\prime}\right)=N-\sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} N\left(P_i\right)+\sum_{1 \leq i<j \leq n} N\left(P_i P_j\right)+\cdots+(-1)^n N\left(P_1 \cdots P_n\right)\\$

#### The Number of Onto Functions

The number of <u>onto function</u>(映成函数) from a set with six elements to a set with three elements is
$
\begin{aligned}
& N\left(P_1^{\prime} P_2^{\prime} P_3^{\prime}\right)=N-N\left(P_1\right)-N\left(P_2\right)-N\left(P_3\right)  +N\left(P_1 P_2\right)+N\left(P_2 P_3\right)+N\left(P_1 P_3\right)-N\left(P_1 P_2 P_3\right)
\end{aligned}
$

$N$ : the number of functions from a set with six elements to a set with three elements.

$N\left(P_i\right)$ : the number of functions that do not have $b_i$ in their range.

$N\left(P_i P_j\right)$ : the number of functions that do not have $b_i$ and $b_j$ in their range.

$N\left(P_1 P_2 P_3\right)$ : the number of functions that do not have $b_1$, $b_2$ and $b_3$ in their range.

`Theorem`: Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers with $m \geq n$. Then there are$
n^m-C(n, 1)(n-1)^m+\cdots+(-1)^{n-1} C(n, n-1) \cdot 1^m
$onto functions from a set with $m$ elements to a set with $n$ elements.

## Chapter 7 Relations

### Relations and Their Properties

#### Relations

`Definition`: A **binary relation** $R$ between $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A\times B$, denoted as $R\subseteq A\times B$. When $A=B$, $R$ is called a relation on set $A$.

- Given a relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$,

  The **domain** of $R$
  $\operatorname{Dom}(R)=\{x \in A \mid(x, y) \in R$ for some $y \in B\}$.
  The range of $R$
  $\operatorname{Ran}(R)=\{y \in B \mid(x, y) \in R$ for some $x \in A\}$.

- Function as relations: Recall a function $f$ from set $A$ to $B$.

- $n$-ary relations: Let $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n$ be sets. An $n$-ary relation on these sets is a subset of $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n . n$ is called its degree.

#### Combining Relations

- Let $R$ be a relation from a set $A$ to $B$ and $S$ a relation from $B$ to $C$. The <u>composite</u> of $R$ and $S$​ is the relation $S \circ R=\{(a, c) \mid a \in A, c \in C ,\exists b \in B$ such that
	$(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in S\}$.

- Let $R$ be a relation on set $A$. The <u>powers</u> $R^n, n=$ $1,2,3, \cdots$ are defined inductively by $
R^1=R$ and $R^{n+1}=R^n \circ R$

- Given a relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$, its <u>inverse</u> $R^{-1}$ is the relation from $B$ to $A$ defined by$
R^{-1}=\{(y, x) \mid(x, y) \in R\}$

#### Properties of Relations

`Definition`: Let $R$ be a relation on a set $A$.

- $R $ is <u>reflexive</u> : $\forall x \in A,(x,x)\in R$'
- $R$ is <u>symmetric</u> : $\forall x,y \in A,(x,y)\in R\Rightarrow (y,x)\in R$.
- $R$ is <u>antisymmetric</u> : $\forall x,y\in A,(x,y)\in R$ and $(y,x)\in R \Rightarrow x=y $.
- $R$ is <u>transitive</u> : $\forall(x,y)\in R,(y,z)\in R\Rightarrow (x,z)\in R$.

`Therom`: The relation $R$ is transitive if and only if $R^n\subseteq R$ for $n=2,3,\cdots$.

### Representing Relations

#### Matrices of Relations

Suppose $R$ a relation from $A=\left\{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m\right\}$ to $B=$ $\left\{b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n\right\}$. The relation $R$ can be represented by matrix $M_R=\left(m_{i j}\right)_{m \times n}$
$
m_{i j}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if }\left(a_i, b_j\right) \in R \\ 0 & \text { if }\left(a_i, b_j\right) \notin R\end{cases}
$

`Example`: Let $A=\{a, b, c, d\}$ and $R=\{(a, a),(b, b),(c, c), (d, d),(b, c),(c, b)\} $.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301291845156.png" alt="image-20230129184533051" style="zoom:50%;" />

`Remark`: 

1. Let $M_R$ be the matrix of a relation $R$ on a set $A$. Let $M_R^2=M_R \circ M_R$.

2. $R$ is reflexive: All terms $m_{ii}$ in the main diagonal of $M_R$ are 1.

3. $R$ is symmetric: $m_{ij}=m_{ji}$ for all $ i$ and $j$.

4. $R$ is anti-symmetric: If $m_{ij}=1$ and $j\ne i$ then $m_{ji}=0$.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202301291903800.png" alt="image-20230129190311706" style="zoom: 30%;" />

5. $R$ is transitive: whenever $c_{ij}$ in $C=M_R^2$ is nonzero then entry $m_{ij}$ in $M_R$ is also nonzero.

- $M_{R_1\cup R_2}= M_{R_1}\or M_{R_2}$
- $M_{R_1\cap R_2}= M_{R_1}\and M_{R_2}$
- $M_{S\circ R}=M_R \odot M_S$ (using matrix multiplication, when $\ge1$, regard as 1)

#### Representing Relations Using Digraphs

Each element of the set is represented by a point, and each ordered pair is represented using an arc with its direction indicated by an arrow — **directed graphs** or **digraphs**.
- A directed graphs or digraphs $G=(V, E)$ :
- a set $V$ of **vertices** (nodes)
- a set $E$ of ordered pairs of elements of $V$ called **edges**(or $\operatorname{arcs})$.
- A edge $(a, b),$ $ a$ - initial vertex and $b$ - terminal vertex
- A edge of form $(a, a)$, called **loop**.

`Remark`: 

- <u>reflexive</u>: There are loops at every vertex of the digraph.
- <u>symmetric</u>: Every edge between distinct vertices with a edge in the opposite direction.

### Closures of Relations

#### Definition of Closures

`Definition`: Let $R$ be a relation on a set $A$. If there is a relation $S$ satisfy:

1) $S$ with property $\mathbf{P}$ (reflexive, symmetry, or transitivity) and $R \subseteq S$
2) $\forall S^{\prime}$ with property $\mathbf{P}$ and $R \subseteq S^{\prime}$, then $S \subseteq S^{\prime}$.(minimum set)

Then $S$ is called the <u>closure</u>(闭包) of $R$ with respect to $\mathbf{P}$.

#### Computing of Closures

`Therom`: Let R be a relation on set $A$.

- The **reflexive closure** of $R$: $r(R)=R\cup \Delta$, where $\Delta = \{(a,a)|a\in A\}$ is diagonal relation on $A$.
- The **symmetric closure** of $R$: $s(R)=R \cup R^{-1}$.
- The **transitive closure/connectivity relation**: $t(R)=R^*=\{(a,b)|$ there's a path from $a$ to $b\}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} R^n\\$.

`Definition`: A **path** from $a$ to $b$ in the directed graph $G$ is a sequence of one or more edges $\left(x_0, x_1\right),\left(x_1, x_2\right), \cdots$, $\left(x_{n-1}, x_n\right)$ in $G$, where $x_0=a$ and $x_n=b$. The path is denoted by $x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n$ and has length $n$.

- A **circuit** or **cycle**: a path that begins and ends at the same vertex.

`Theorem`: Let $R$ be a relation on set $A$. There is a path of length $n$ from $a$ to $b \Leftrightarrow(a, b) \in R^n$.

`Theorem`: Let $M_R$ be the zero-one matrix of the relation $R$ on a set with $n$ elements. Then the zero-one matrix of the transitive closure $R^*$ is $
M_{R^*}=M_R \vee M_R^{[2]} \vee M_R^{[3]} \vee \cdots \vee M_R^{[n]} .$

```pascal
procedure transitive closure(M_R: zero-one n*n matrix)
A := M_R
B := A
for i := 2 to n
	A := A * M_R
	B := B \or A
return B // B is the zero-one matrix for R^*
```

#### Warshall's Algorithm

Suppose that $R$ is a relation on a set with $n$ elements. Let $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ be an arbitrary listing of these $n$ elements. The concept of the **interior vertices**(内部顶点) of a path is used in Warshall's algorithm. If $a, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m-1}, b$ is a path, its interior vertices are $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m-1}$, that is, all the vertices of the path that occur somewhere other than as the first and last vertices in the path. 

Warshall's algorithm is based on the construction of a sequence of zero-one matrices. These matrices are $\mathbf{W}_0, \mathbf{W}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{W}_n$, where $\mathbf{W}_0=\mathbf{M}_R$ is the zero-one matrix of this relation, and $\mathbf{W}_k=\left[w_{i j}^{(k)}\right]$, where $w_{i j}^{(k)}=1$ if there is a path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ such that all the interior vertices of this path are in the set $\left\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\right\}$ (the first $k$ vertices in the list) and is 0 otherwise. (The first and last vertices in the path may be outside the set of the first $k$ vertices in the list.) Note that $\mathbf{W}_n=\mathbf{M}_{R^*}$, because the ( $i, j$ )th entry of $\mathbf{M}_{R^*}$ is 1 if and only if there is a path from $v_i$ to $v_j$, with all interior vertices in the set $\left\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\right\}$ (but these are the only vertices in the directed graph). 

($W_i$: If $j$ can link to $i$, then add i-row to j-row.)

### Equivalence Relations

#### Definition of Equivalence Relations

`Definition`: Relation $R_{\sim}:A\leftrightarrow A$ is an <u>equivalence relation</u>, if it's reflexive, symmetric, transitive.

#### Equivalence Classes and Its Properties

`Definition`: Let $R: A \leftrightarrow A$ is an equivalence relation. For any $a \in A$, the <u>equivalence class</u>(等价类) of $a$ is the set of the elements related to $a$: $[a]_R=\{x \in A \mid(x, a) \in R\}
$. If $b \in[a]_R, b$ is called a representative of this equivalence class.

The properties of equivalence classes:

1) $\forall a \in A,[a]_R \neq \emptyset$ (By reflexivity, $a \in[a]_R$ );
2) $(a, b) \in R \Rightarrow[a]_R=[b]_R$;
3) $(a, b) \notin R \Rightarrow[a]_R \cap[b]_R=\emptyset$;
4) $\bigcup_{a \in A}[a]_R=A$. $\quad\left(A \subseteq \bigcup_{a \in A}[a]_R \subseteq A\right)$

`Definition`: The set of all equivalence classes of $R$ is the <u>quotient set</u>(商集) of $A$ with respect to $R$. $A/R=\{[a]_R | a\in A\}$.

#### Equivalence Classes and Partitions

`Definition`: A <u>partition</u> $\pi$ on a set $S$ is a family $\left\{A_1, A_2\right.$, $\left.\cdots, A_n\right\}$ of subsets of $S$ and

1) $\bigcup_{k=1}^n A_k=S \\ $
2) $A_j \cap A_k=\emptyset$ for every $j, k$ with $j \neq k, 1<j, k<n$.

`Theorem`: Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $S$. Then the equivalence classes of $R$ form a partition of $X$. Conversely, given a partition $\left\{A_i \mid i \in I\right\}$ of set $S$, there is an equivalence relation $R$ that has the set $A_i, i \in I$, as its equivalence classes.

### Partial Orderings

#### Definition of Partial Orderings

`Definition`: Relation $R_{\preceq}: S \leftrightarrow S$ is a <u>partial order</u>(偏序), if it reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
A set $S$ together with a partial ordering $R_{\preceq}$ is called a **partial order set** or **poset**, and is denoted by $\left(S, R_{\preceq}\right)$.

#### Lexicographic Order

Construct a partial ordering on the Cartesian product of two posets $\left(A_1, \preceq_1\right)$ and $\left(A_2, \preceq_2\right)$. The <u>lexicographic ordering</u> $\preceq$ on $A_1 \times A_2$ is defined by: $\left(a_1, a_2\right)$ is less than $\left(b_1, b_2\right)$, that is, $
\left(a_1, a_2\right) \prec\left(b_1, b_2\right)
$either if $a_1 \prec_1 b_1$ or if both $a_1=b_1$ and $a_1 \prec_2 b_2$.

#### Hasse Diagram

Represent a partial ordering on a finite set using the following procedure:

1. Start with the directed graph for the relation.
2. Remove all loops.
3. Remove all edges that must be present because of the transitivity.
4. Arrange each edges so that its initial vertex is below its terminal vertex, remove all the arrows.

#### Maximal and Minimal Elements

`Definition`: Let $(A, \preceq)$ be a partial ordered set, $B \subseteq A$.

1) $a$ is a **maximal element**(极大元) of $B: a \in B \wedge$ There is no $x \in B$ such that $a \prec x$.
$b$ is a **minimal element**(极小元) of $B: b \in B \wedge$ There is no $x \in B$ such that $x \prec b$.
2) $a$ is the **greatest element**(最大元) of $B: a \in B \wedge \forall x \in$ $B(x \preceq a)$.
$b$ is the **least element**(最小元) of $B: b \in B \wedge \forall x \in B(b \preceq$ $x)$

3) $c$ is an **upper bound** of $B: c \in A \wedge \forall x \in B: x \preceq c$.
$d \in A$ is an **lower bound** of $B: d \in A \wedge \forall x \in B: d \preceq x$.
4) $c$ is an **least upper bound** of $B: c$ is a upper bound of $B$ and $\forall x$ is a upper bound of $B \Rightarrow c \preceq x$.
$d \in A$ is an **greatest lower bound** of $B: d$ is a lower bound of $B$ and $\forall x$ is a lower bound of $B \Rightarrow x \preceq d$.

#### Lattices

`Definition`: A partially ordered set in which pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound is called <u>lattice</u>(格).

## Chapter 8 Graphs

### Introduction to Graphs

#### Introduction

#### Types of Graphs

`Definition`:

- A **simple graph** $G=(V, E)$ consists of $V$, a nonempty set of vertices, and $E$, a set of unordered pair of distinct elements of $V$ called edges.

- A **multigraph** $G=(V, E)$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices, and a set $E$ of edges, and a function from $E$ to $\{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$. The edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are called multiple or parallel edges if $f\left(e_1\right)=f\left(e_2\right)$.

- A **pseudograph**(伪图) $G=(V, E)$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices, and a set $E$ of edges, and a function from $E$ to $\{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V\}$. An edge is a loop if $f(e)=\{u, u\}=\{u\}$ for some $u \in V$.

- A **directed graph** $G=(V, E)$ consists of a set of vertices $V$, and a set of edges $E$ that are ordered pairs of elements of $V$.

- A **directed multigraph** $G=(V, E)$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices, and a set $E$ of edges, and a function from $E$ to $\{(u, v) \mid u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$. The edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are called parallel edges if $f\left(e_1\right)=f\left(e_2\right)$.

### Graph Terminology

#### Basic Terminology

- **Undirected Graph**

Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are called <u>adjacent</u> or <u>neighbors</u> if $e=\{u, v\}$ is a edge of $G$.

If $e=\{u, v\}$, the edge $e$ is called <u>incident with</u> $u$ and $v$. The edge $e$ is also said to connect $u$ and $v . u$ and $v$ are called <u>endpoints</u>

The <u>degree</u> of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident with it, except that a loop at a vertex contribute twice to the degree of that vertex, denoted by $\operatorname{deg}(v)$.

Isolated vertex: $d e g=0$. Pendant vertex : $\operatorname{deg}=1$.

`Theorem`: (The Handshaking Theorem) If $G$ is a graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n$, then$
\sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{deg}\left(v_i\right)=2 m\\$
In particular, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices of a graph is even.

- **Directed Graph**

When $(u, v)$ is an edge of the graph $G$ with directed edges. $u$ is said to be <u>adjacent</u>(邻接) to $v$ and $v$ is said to be <u>adjacent</u> from $u$.
$u$ is called initial vertex, $v$ is called terminal or end vertex. The initial vertex and terminal vertex of a loop are the same.

The <u>in-degree</u> of a vertex $v$, denoted by $\operatorname{deg}^{-} v$, is the number of edges with $v$ as their terminal vertex.  The <u>out-degree</u> of a vertex $v$, denoted by $\operatorname{deg}^{+} v$, is the number of edges with $v$ as their initial vertex.
(Note that a loop at a vertex contributes 1 to both the in-degree and the out-degree of this vertex.)

`Therom`: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with directed edges. Then $\sum_{i=1}^n deg^-(v_i)=\sum_{i=1}^n deg^+(v_i)=|E|\\$.

#### Some Special Simple Graph

1. Complete Graph

The complete graph $K_n$ is the simple graph with $n$ vertices and every pair of vertices is joined by an edge. $|E|=C(n,2)$.

![image-20230201210052081](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202302012100203.png)

2. Cycles

The cycle $C_n,(n\ge3)$ consists of $n$ vertices $v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n$ and edges $\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_2,v_3\},\cdots,\{v_{n-1},v_n\}$ and $\{v_n,v_1\}$.

![image-20230201210350991](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202302012103071.png)

3. Wheel

We obtain a wheel $W_n$ when we add an additional vertex to a cycle $C_n$, for $n ≥ 3$, and connect this new vertex to each of the $n$ vertices in $C_n$, by new edges. 

![image-20230201210544470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202302012105549.png)

4. n-Cubes

The n-Cube, denoted by $Q_n$, is the graph that has vertices representing the $2^n$ bit strings of length $n$.

![image-20230201210743130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202302012107208.png)

5. Bipartite Graph

A bipartite graph(二分图) $G=(V,E)$ is a graph such that $\begin{cases} V=V_1\cup V_2 \\ V_1\cap V_2=\emptyset \end{cases}$. No edges exist between any two vertices in the same sub-set $V_1$ and $V_2$.

`Definition`: A bipartite graph is the **complete bipartite graph** $K_{m,n}$ if every vertex in $V_1$ is joined to a vertex in $V_2$ and conversely, $|V_1|=m,|V_2|=n$.

![image-20230201211849900](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cedar17/PicGo_PictureBed/main/img/202302012118984.png)

#### New Graphs from Old

`Definition`: $G=(V, E),\quad H=(W, F)$

- $H$ is a <u>subgraph</u> of $G$, if $W \subseteq V, F \subseteq E$.
- $H$ is a <u>spanning subgraph</u> of $G$, if $W=V, F \subseteq E$.
- The <u>union</u> of two simple graph $G_1=\left(V_1, E_1\right)$ and $G_2=\left(V_2, E_2\right)$ is the simple graph with vertex set $V_1 \cup V_2$ and edge set $E_1 \cup E_2$. The union of $G_1$ and $G_2$ is denoted by $G_1 \cup G_2$.

### Representing Graphs & Graph Isomorphism

#### Representing Graphs

- Adjacency Matrix

`Definition`: Let $G$ be a simple graph. The <u>adjacency matrix</u>(邻接矩阵) $A=[a_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ where $a_{ij}=\begin{cases} 1\quad \text{if }\{ v_i,v_j\}\in E \\ 0 \quad \text{otherwhise.} \end{cases}$

`Definition`: Let G be an undirected graph with loops
and multiple edges. The <u>adjacency matrix</u>
$A=[a_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ where
$a_{ij}=$
the number of edges that are associated to $\{v_i,v_j\}$.

- Incidence Matrix

`Definition`: Let $G=(V, E)$ be an undirected graph. Suppose that $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n$ are the vertices and $e_1, e_2, \cdots e_m$ are the edges. Then the <u>incidence matrix</u>(关联矩阵) with respect to this ordering of $V$ and $E$ is matrix $M=\left[m_{i j}\right]_{n \times m}$, where
$m_{i j}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { when edge } e_j \text { is incidence with } v_i \\ 0 & \text { otherwise. }\end{cases}$

#### Isomorphism of Graphs

`Definition`: Two simple graphs $G_1=\left(V_1, E_1\right)$ and $G_2=$ $\left(V_2, E_2\right)$ are called <u>isomorphic</u>(同构), if there is a bijection $f$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$ with the property$
\forall a, b \in V_1,(a, b) \in E_1 \Longleftrightarrow(f(a), f(b)) \in E_2$. Bijection $f$ is called an <u>isomorphism</u>.

### Connectivity

#### Paths

`Definition`: A <u>path</u> of length $n\left(n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right)$from $u$ to $v$ in an undirected graph is a sequence of edges $e_1, \cdots, e_n$ of the graph such that
$f\left(e_1\right)=\left\{x_0, x_1\right\}, f\left(e_2\right)=\left\{x_1, x_2\right\}, \cdots, f\left(e_n\right)=\left\{x_{n-1}, x_n\right\}$
where $x_0=u$ and $x_n=v$.

- The path is a <u>circuit</u> if it begins and ends at the same vertex.
- A path or circuit is **simple** if it does not contain the same edge more than once.
- The graph is simple, we denote this path by its vertex sequence $x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n$.

#### Connectedness in Undirected Graphs

`Definition`: 

- An undirected graph is called **connected** if there is a
	path between every pair of distinct vertices of the graph. 
- When a graph that is not connected is the union of two
	or more connected subgraphs
	— are called the connected
	components.

`Therom`: There are a simple path between every pair of distinct vertices of a connected undirected graph.

`Definition`: 

The removal of a vertex and all edges incident with it produces a subgraph with more connected components than in the original graph. Such vertices are called <u>cut vertices</u>.

An edge whose removal produces a subgraph with more connected components than in the original graph is called a <u>cut edge</u> or <u>bridge</u>.

#### Connectedness in Directed Graphs

`Definition`: 

- An directed graph is <u>strongly connected</u> if there is a path from $a$ to $b$ whenever $ a$ and $b$ are verticces in the graph.
- An directed graph is <u>weakly connected</u> if there is a path between any two vertices in the underlying undirected graph.

#### Counting Paths Between Vertices

`Theorem`: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A$ with respect to the ordering $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n$. The number of different paths of length $r$ from $v_i$ to $v_j$, where $r$ is a positive integer, equals to the $(i, j)$ th entry of $A^r$.
