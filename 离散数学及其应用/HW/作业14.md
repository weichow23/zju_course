We notice that there are two vertices in each graph that are not in cycles of size 4. So let us try to construct an isomorphism that matches them, say u1 $ v2 and u8 $ v6 . Now u1 is adjacent to u2 and u3 , and v2 is adjacent to v1 and v3 , so we try u2 $ v1 and u3 $ v3 . Then since u4 is the other vertex adjacent to u3 and v4 is the other vertex adjacent to v3 (and we already matched u3 and v3 ), we must have u4 $ v4 .
Proceeding along similar lines, we then complete the bijection with u5 $ v8 , u6 $ v7 , and u7 $ v5 . Having thus been led to the only possible isomorphism, we check that the 12 edges of G exactly correspond to the 12 edges of H, and we have proved that the two graphs are isomorphic.

> Let $G = (V, E) $be a simple graph. Let R be the relation on V consisting of pairs of vertices $(u, v)$ such that there is a path from u to v or such that $u = v$. Show that R is an equivalence relation.

$R$ is reflexive by definition. Assume that (u, v) ∈ R; then there is a path from u to v. Then (v, u) ∈ R because there is a path from v to u, namely, the path from u to v traversed backward. Assume that (u, v) ∈ R and (v, w) ∈ R; then there are paths from u to v and from v to w. Putting these two paths together gives a path from u to w. Hence, (u, w) ∈ R. It follows that R is transitive.
